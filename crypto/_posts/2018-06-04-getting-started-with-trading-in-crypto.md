This article will outline steps to get started with trading in cryptocurrencies. This post is for anyone who wants to trade cryptocurrencies. It is assumed that the reader knows about [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) and [Altcoins](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/altcoin.asp).

Still I will go through some important terms which will help in understanding the crypto scenario better.

### Peer to Peer Network
It means that there is not centralized server. Instead there are Nodes in a network which run corresponding cryptocurrency client. For example 
- Bitcoin runs on a peer to peer network. If you run Bitcoin client, you become a part of the network. The nodes on the network exchange transactions, blocks and addresses of other peers with each other.
- [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing (**P2P**) which is used to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet.

### Bitcoin 
It used peer to peer network to manage transactions. This was the first successful cryptocurrency that was created and the white paper for this came anonymously in 2008 (Just after the great depression). Satoshi Nakamoto was the alias used to publish the white paper for Bitcoin. 

### Altcoins
Altcoins are alternative cryptourrencies which came after the success of bitcoin. They try to fill the gaps which bitcoin was not able to fill i.e bitcoin has some drawbacks like it is a mineable coin thus consumes a lot of electric power in verifying the transactions, etc. But new projects altcoins are of both types mineable and non-mineable. Basically altcoins solve domain specific problems like 
- [Substratum](https://substratum.net/) is working to create a decentralised web. Substratum is an open-source network that allows anyone to allocate spare computing resources to make the internet a free and fair place for the entire world.
- [Morpheus Network](https://morpheus.network/) is trying to solve supply chain problem using Blockchain. Morpheus Network was designed in consultation with some of the world’s largest shipping, customs and banking firms to create a full service, global, automated supply-chain platform with an integrated cryptocurrency payment system utilizing Blockchain technology. The world bank has defined supply chain inefficiencies as the **_#1_** World Problem to solve in order to stimulate economic growth. Morpheus Network is the solution.

Similarly there are quite a lot of blockchain projects out there to solve domain specific problems.

### Cryptocurrency Wallet
A cryptocurrency wallet is a software program which uses your public and private key to interact with various blockchains to enable users to send and receive digital currency. Wallets can be broadly categorised into software, hardware and paper.

### Public and Private Key
Public key is wallets public address. It is used to receive currencies. Suppose someone want to send us some BTC. So we would give him/her our BTC wallet public address and he/she can send BTC using that public address. If you want to send BTC to someone, you would need your private key and target’s public key. This concept is widely known as [Public Key Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).

### Crypto Exchange
Cryptocurrency exchange or digital currency exchange are business that allow users to trade cryptocurrencies in exchange of other cryptocurrencies or fiat money. They charge some service fees for each transaction.

### Airdrop
It’s a time limited event created by coin projects to promote their project in the community. Generally they ask you to share or tweet about their project and in exchange provide you some tokens or coins. The conditions for airdrop vary project to project. Some might ask simple share others might ask you to publish a post or make a video about their project. In the end it's all about marketing their project for coins.

## Trading Cryptocurrencies
Trading cryptocurrencies is similar to trading stocks. You need to have an account on a Crypto Exchange. There are a lot of exchanges out there but the best ones are listed below:
- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=11766965)
- [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/)
- [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=23sQ3)
- [Coin Exchange](https://www.coinexchange.io/?r=a49cc35b)

> **For Indian Audience**<br/>
> You cannot send money to these exchanges as these are foreign exchanges and sending money to those exchanges for trading is against [FEMA act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Exchange_Management_Act) (In simple terms its illegal).<br/> 
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Exchange_Management_Act)<br/>
FEMA Act (Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999) is an act of Parliament of India "to consolidate and amend the law relating to foreign exchange with the objective of facilitating external trade and payments and for promoting the orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India".<br/>
There are some Indian exchanges like [Zebpay](http://link.zebpay.com/ref/REF20038197), ThroughBit, etc through which you can buy cryptocurrencies. [Zebpay](http://link.zebpay.com/ref/REF20038197) now offers quite a lot of coins to trade like [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) (BTC), [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) (ETH), [EOS](https://eos.io/), [OMG](https://omisego.network/), [XRP](https://ripple.com/xrp/), [LTC](https://litecoin.com/) etc.
- Open an account with Zebpay.
- Send money from your bank account to Zebpay account. (deposit details would be on Zebpay App)
- Now you can buy cryptocurrencies from Zebpay with money that you deposited.

> **NOTE:** It is suggested to buy BTC or ETH from Zebpay and transfer them to any foreign exchange like [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=11766965), [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=23sQ3), etc. As Indian Government is changing rules constantly trying to regulate crypto trading.

Once you have BTC or ETH on exchange you can trade it for altcoins (SUBS, ADA, etc). 
If you want to hold cryptocurrencies as assets with you and not on any exchange. Then you can store them in cold wallets or hot wallets.<br/> 
Remember when you hold digital currencies in an exchange then the private key is stored with the exchange i.e if the exchange got hacked or something they there is a possibility that you might lose your assets. Depending upon the policy of the exchange they might or might not give you money equivalent to assets that you lost.

Some resources which would help you to monitor and stay update with what happening in cryptocurrency domain are:
- [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) - This site lists all the cryptocurrencies which are tradable. Think of this as [Screener](https://www.screener.in/) for stocks. It can sort currencies based on Market Cap, Price, Volume, Change in 24hrs.

- [Data Dash](https://www.youtube.com/c/DataDash) - It's a YouTube channel by [Nicholas Merten](https://twitter.com/Nicholas_Merten). This channel is one stop shop for cryptocurrency analysis. He introduces new projects in Blockchain domain too.
- [TradingView](https://in.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSD) - Use TradingView to perform technical analysis on currencies. Screenshot below shows daily chart for BTC/USD on Bitfinex exchange.

> **NOTE:** Always invest what you are willing to lose. As cryptocurrencies is relatively new market with no regulations, so there is more probability of scamming and high volatility in market value. But If you follow resources mentioned above plus do your own research, you are good to go.

That is all you need to know to trade in cryptocurrencies. For any queries or suggestion, you can write to us at [investingknight@gmail.com](mailto:investingknight@gmail.com)

In the next post, I will discuss about Bitcoin Implementation in detail i.e how public key cryptography is used in wallet generation and how a transaction is created, signed by private key, and broadcasted into bitcoin network.
