This post is in continuation with [“**Who is winning this war?**”](https://investingknights.com/2018/03/15/who-is-winning-this-war/)<br/>
We have learned that we are surrounded by winners and that’s the reason why they are called winners.<br/>

That said, you don’t have to be Stan Lee to learn that Marvel Studios is creating a lot of buzz in the film industry and have people quite excited for their next Avenger film.<br/>

You don’t have to be an executive at **McDonalds** to know that teenagers prefer treating their friends in McDonalds over celebrating their birthdays at home. You can be a cashier, a cook, a delivery boy, a customer or even someone who washes floor at Mc’D to know that the franchise needs new outlets due to overcrowding in its existing ones.<br/>

You don’t have to be a CEO of Maruti Suzuki to know that the company is the undisputed leader in the **Automobile Industry** even after severe competition from the foreign players. Just go anywhere on the road and you can see that approximately every third car is made by Maruti.<br/>

You don’t have to be vice president of **Page Industries** to know that Jockey’s underwears are selling like hotcakes and have become a thing that can be flaunted. I came to know that through the following conversation with my friend, Rishabh.<br/>

>**Me:** Hey, pull up your pants. Your red underwear is showing<br/>
**Rishabh:** Oops sorry! By the way, it’s Jockey<br/>
**Me:** Oh, is it worth the money?<br/>
**Rishabh:** Yeah, it’s quite comfortable than the Amul Macho I used to wear.<br/>
**Me:** How much does it cost?<br/>
**Rishabh:** I don’t know, my mom buys it for me. I got a couple of these on my 22nd birthday.<br/>
**Me:** Cool Indian Mom.

And that’s why I’ve stopped pointing out to people if their underwears are showing. Learned through an unusual way though.<br/>
Well, all I mean is, always keep an eye around you, your friends and what your friends’ moms are buying and you may land up on your winner.<br/>

### **Why should I join with the company who's winning?**

### **What's in it for me?**

**First**, by joining hands with the winners, you get to [***compound***](https://investingknights.com/2018/03/17/befriending-compound-interest/) your money.

**Second**, our society is a capitalistic one.<br/>
Anyone can start his/her business, no one is assigned a particular role in the community.<br/>
Therefore, **anyone can do whatever he/she wants and utilise their full compatibility**<br/>

So these companies are nothing but a group of individuals from **our own society** who have taken the initiative to start a business on their own.<br/>
If you join them, it's a step towards realising their plans</br
If you believe in their potential and somehow it does gets realised, you're rewarded multiple times the money you offer to help them.

For example, look at stock price of **Maruti Suzuki**<br/>

<img src="/images/posts/p4_p1.png" alt="Maruti Share Price" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

Current Price INR 8694<br/>
Price back in 2003: INR 170

My father bought Maruti 800 for INR 2.3 lakhs (Year 2003)

If he had bought stocks of the company instead, we would have around

2.3 lakhs X (8694/170) = 117.62 lakhs or ***INR 1.17 crore***

Which would look something like this

Unfortunately, all I have is 

<img src="/images/posts/p4_p3.png" alt="Maruti 800" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

Sad news, the car got stolen last month. I don't even have the car now.

Yeah, I can hear you laughing.

So I think, it's pretty clear why should you join the warriors in this [**Corporate War of Money**](https://investingknights.com/2018/03/14/war-of-money/). It's a win-win situation for everyone.

### I’ve got it! I’ve got it! – How do I join with company?

There are two ways to join with company -
- **Through BONDS**
- **Through STOCKS**

<img src="/images/posts/p4_1.jpg" alt="Stocks and Bonds" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

The companies issue each of them in order to raise the cash for their operations. However, Bonds and Stocks both come under the category of Investments but are completely different from each other.<br/> 
I’ll try to define these terms in the easiest language possible.

### BONDS

Similar to a loan that a company wants to take but not from the bank only. Me and you can loan out money to the company if we are satisfied with the interest rate along with the time frame. **The company is bound to return the money in the given time frame along with the interest.**<br/> 
If it doesn’t, the company will be called as defaulter and bond holders (you and me) will be paid first after selling off the company’s assets. **Enforcement Directorate** (A government body) is empowered to sell the defaulter’s assets.<br/>
Let’s understand this with an example. Rishabh starts a new company and issues the bonds.

>**Rishabh:** Hey! What’s up man? I need a little favour, I’ve started my own company and have a product in my mind. I need some money to buy machinery to manufacture the product.<br/>
**Me:** Fair enough. How much is the bond and the interest rate?<br/>
**Rishabh:** It’s INR 10 lakh, for a period of 5 years and I’ll return with an interest of 8% per annum.<br/>
**Me:** Okay, we have a deal.<br/>
**Rishabh:** Thank you.<br/>
\*After 5 years, the bond matures and I knock on Rishabh’s door\*<br/>
**Rishabh:** \*Watching Two and a half men\* Hey! How come after 5 years?<br/>
**Me:** Nice series you’re watching \*Charlie Sheen cracks a joke\* HAHAHAHA!<br/>
**Rishabh:**  HAHAHAH!<br/>
**Me:** Where’s my money?<br/>
**Rishabh:** HAHAHA!<br/>
**Me:** I’m serious. The bond has matured, I want my money back<br/>
**Rishabh:** Lost it man. Can I do anything else for you?<br/>
**Me:** \*Looks at his well-furnished home, Apple iPhone X\* Yeah sure. Talk to the Enforcement Directorate (ED)<br/>
**ED:** \*Looks at Rishabh\* You disgusting defaulter.<br/> 
\*Snatches his iPhone X\*<br/>
\*Loads his television, laptop and refrigerator in the truck\*<br/>
\*Ties his car to the tow truck\*<br/>
**ED:** Anything else?<br/>
**Me:** His Jockey underwear!<br/>
**ED:** You got me dude! \*Laughs hysterically\*<br/>
**Rishabh:** You guys, seriously? Even the one that I’m wearing?<br/>
**ED:** This bond is serious agreement bro, no hard feelings!<br/>
\*Goes ahead does the honours\*<br/>

This is what actually happens. Literally everything is taken away by the ED if a company defaults on its bonds. Let’s move on to the second type of Investment.

### STOCKS

**A stock is part of a company that is used to signify the ownership of its holder (stockholder) in the company’s earnings and assets.**<br/>
If the company grows, the stock price will grow too.<br/>
If the company fails and files for bankruptcy, the stock price will crash.<br/>

We can own a stock of a company just as we own the mobile/laptop/tablet on which you’re reading this except that **it’s only available on the Stock Exchange (A market where stocks are bought and sold) and you cannot buy it directly**.<br/>
**You need a stock broker to buy stocks on your behalf**. This is not so in case of the bonds.<br/>

Also, if the company goes into ground, the owners are not liable to payback any shareholder. Therefore, **stocks are riskier than bonds**.<br/>

**Having said that, you shouldn’t buy either of them without proper research.**

**Landing on your favourite company is just a lead to a story that is yet to be developed.**

Developing the story is really easy and will take a couple of hours at most.<br/>
In further posts I’ll demonstrate how to do it.<br/>
Until then, goodbye and thank you for reading 😊
