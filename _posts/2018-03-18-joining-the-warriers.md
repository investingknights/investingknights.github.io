This post is in continuation with [‚Äú**Who is winning this war?**‚Äù](https://investingknights.com/2018/03/15/who-is-winning-this-war/)<br/>
We have learned that we are surrounded by winners and that‚Äôs the reason why they are called winners.<br/>
That said, you don‚Äôt have to be Stan Lee to learn that Marvel Studios is creating a lot of buzz in the film industry and have people quite excited for their next Avenger film.<br/>

You don‚Äôt have to be an executive at **McDonalds** to know that teenagers prefer treating their friends in McDonalds over celebrating their birthdays at home. You can be a cashier, a cook, a delivery boy, a customer or even someone who washes floor at Mc‚ÄôD to know that the franchise needs new outlets due to overcrowding in its existing ones.<br/>

You don‚Äôt have to be a CEO of Maruti Suzuki to know that the company is the undisputed leader in the **Automobile Industry** even after severe competition from the foreign players. Just go anywhere on the road and you can see that approximately every third car is made by Maruti.<br/>

You don‚Äôt have to be vice president of **Page Industries** to know that Jockey‚Äôs underwears are selling like hotcakes and have become a thing that can be flaunted. I came to know that through the following conversation with my friend, Rishabh.<br/>

>**Me:** Hey, pull up your pants. Your red underwear is showing<br/>
**Rishabh:** Oops sorry! By the way, it‚Äôs Jockey<br/>
**Me:** Oh, is it worth the money?<br/>
**Rishabh:** Yeah, it‚Äôs quite comfortable than the Amul Macho I used to wear.<br/>
**Me:** How much does it cost?<br/>
**Rishabh:** I don‚Äôt know, my mom buys it for me. I got a couple of these on my 22nd birthday.<br/>
**Me:** Cool Indian Mom.

And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve stopped pointing out to people if their underwears are showing. Learned through an unusual way though.<br/>
Well, all I mean is, always keep an eye around you, your friends and what your friends‚Äô moms are buying and you may land up on your winner.<br/>

### I‚Äôve got it! I‚Äôve got it! ‚Äì How do I join with company?

There are two ways to join with company -
- **Through BONDS**
- **Through STOCKS**

<img src="/images/posts/p4_1.jpg" alt="ITC Products" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

The companies issue each of them in order to raise the cash for their operations. However, Bonds and Stocks both come under the category of Investments but are completely different from each other.<br/> 
I‚Äôll try to define these terms in the easiest language possible.

### BONDS

Similar to a loan that a company wants to take but not from the bank only. Me and you can loan out money to the company if we are satisfied with the interest rate along with the time frame. **The company is bound to return the money in the given time frame along with the interest.**<br/> 
If it doesn‚Äôt, the company will be called as defaulter and bond holders (you and me) will be paid first after selling off the company‚Äôs assets. **Enforcement Directorate** (A government body) is empowered to sell the defaulter‚Äôs assets.<br/>
Let‚Äôs understand this with an example. Rishabh starts a new company and issues the bonds.

>**Rishabh:** Hey! What‚Äôs up man? I need a little favour, I‚Äôve started my own company and have a product in my mind. I need some money to buy machinery to manufacture the product.<br/>
**Me:** Fair enough. How much is the bond and the interest rate?<br/>
**Rishabh:** It‚Äôs INR 10 lakh, for a period of 5 years and I‚Äôll return with an interest of 8% per annum.<br/>
**Me:** Okay, we have a deal.<br/>
**Rishabh:** Thank you.<br/>
\*After 5 years, the bond matures and I knock on Rishabh‚Äôs door\*<br/>
**Rishabh:** \*Watching Two and a half men\* Hey! How come after 5 years?<br/>
**Me:** Nice series you‚Äôre watching \*Charlie Sheen cracks a joke\* HAHAHAHA!<br/>
**Rishabh:**  HAHAHAH!<br/>
**Me:** Where‚Äôs my money?<br/>
**Rishabh:** HAHAHA!<br/>
**Me:** I‚Äôm serious. The bond has matured, I want my money back<br/>
**Rishabh:** Lost it man. Can I do anything else for you?<br/>
**Me:** \*Looks at his well-furnished home, Apple iPhone X\* Yeah sure. Talk to the Enforcement Directorate (ED)<br/>
**ED:** \*Looks at Rishabh\* You disgusting defaulter.<br/> 
\*Snatches his iPhone X\*<br/>
\*Loads his television, laptop and refrigerator in the truck\*<br/>
\*Ties his car to the tow truck\*<br/>
**ED:** Anything else?<br/>
**Me:** His Jockey underwear!<br/>
**ED:** You got me dude! \*Laughs hysterically\*<br/>
**Rishabh:** You guys, seriously? Even the one that I‚Äôm wearing?<br/>
**ED:** This bond is serious agreement bro, no hard feelings!<br/>
\*Goes ahead does the honours\*<br/>

This is what actually happens. Literally everything is taken away by the ED if a company defaults on its bonds. Let‚Äôs move on to the second type of Investment.

### STOCKS

**A stock is part of a company that is used to signify the ownership of its holder (stockholder) in the company‚Äôs earnings and assets.**<br/>
If the company grows, the stock price will grow too.<br/>
If the company fails and files for bankruptcy, the stock price will crash.<br/>
We can own a stock of a company just as we own the mobile/laptop/tablet on which you‚Äôre reading this except that **it‚Äôs only available on the Stock Exchange (A market where stocks are bought and sold) and you cannot buy it directly**.<br/>
**You need a stock broker to buy stocks on your behalf**. This is not so in case of the bonds.<br/>
Also, if the company goes into ground, the owners are not liable to payback any shareholder. Therefore, **stocks are riskier than bonds**.<br/>
Having said that, you shouldn‚Äôt buy either of them without proper research.

**Landing on your favourite company is just a lead to a story that is yet to be developed.**

Developing the story is really easy and will take a couple of hours at most.<br/>
In further posts I‚Äôll demonstrate how to do it.<br/>
Until then, goodbye and thank you for reading üòä
