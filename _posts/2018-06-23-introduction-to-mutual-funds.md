After reading this article, you’ll know everything that you need to know about investing in Mutual Funds and you can do the same without anyone’s help.

## What exactly is a Mutual Fund?
A Mutual Fund is an investment scheme which invests your money on your behalf into diversified holdings such as equity, gold, bonds, commodities and real estate etc. It promises certain rate of return for which it charges a small fee.

**Mutual Funds (MFs)** are managed by well qualified and experienced professionals who are best suited to maximise returns while minimizing losses.<br/> 
This is the reason why MFs are always recommended for beginners who have no idea regarding investing.<br/> 
Investing in MFs is much safer than investing in equity on your own if you don’t have any experience.

## Types of Mutual Funds
## 1. DEBT Fund
It functions similar to bank that is, the money invested in a debt fund is given as loan or bond to private companies, State or Indian Government.<br/>
Debt fund offers maximum security of principal but this comes at a cost; a lower rate of return that is, 7-8%.<br/>
There are also many types of debt funds:
* **Gilt Funds:** Money is loaned to government
* **Income Funds:** It gives monthly income, suitable for retired people
* **Short Term Debt Funds:** Investment horizon is short, 2-3 years
* **Fixed Maturity Plans:** Close ended schemes. In other words, investors can subscribe to this scheme only during the offer period
* **Liquid Funds:** You can withdraw your money anytime, just like normal savings account.

## 2. EQUITY Fund
**An Equity Fund is a Mutual Fund Scheme that invests predominantly in shares/stocks of companies. They are also known as Growth Funds.**<br/>
These are the most famous type of mutual funds.
### Types of Equity Funds
The fund invests in companies according to their market capitalization
1. **Large Cap:** These are huge companies who are very famous and market capitalization is in lakhs of crores. Maruti Suzuki, SBI, HDFC, ITC and HUL are some examples
2. **Mid Cap:** These are average sized companies whose market capitalization ranges from 10-30 thousand crores
3. **Small Cap:** These are small sized companies, Market Cap ranges from 2-5 thousand crores
4. **Micro Cap:** These are totally unknown companies, Market Cap ranges from a few hundred crores to a thousand crores.

## 3. HYBRID Fund
Hybrid fund invests in two or more different type of asset categories so that it can have benefits from both.<br/>
For example, a debt fund gives better security but lower return and an equity fund gives lower security and higher return. Those investors who have moderate risk appetite and want higher return than a debt fund but more security than an equity fund can go for a HYBRID fund.

## 4. INDEX Fund
Through index funds, you can invest directly in benchmark indices like SENSEX, NIFTY etc.<br/>
Index funds are not managed by any professional since stocks in the indices are already defined.<br/>
INDEX fund has the minimum charges because it doesn’t need any manager and runs totally on autopilot.

**I will have a separate post on Index fund outlining its qualities.**

## 5. FUND of Funds
These funds invest your money in other funds. The load (charges) for this type of fund is maximum.

So now you know what is a mutual fund and its types. But, do you know what type of MF is good for you.<br/> 
Choosing a MF that best aligns with your goal is really a headache!

## How to choose a Mutual Fund?
### Step 1: Determine your risk appetite
Before investing in MFs, you should be aware of the amount of risk that you can take.
* If you are young, you can take substantial risk and invest in equity fund especially midcap and small cap.
* If you have high net worth, then invest in large cap equity.
* If you are in your 40s the you can invest in hybrid funds because they offer both return and security
* If you are about to retire and have zero risk appetite, then you can go ahead and invest in debt fund.

Even if you’ve determined your level of risk, still you may end up with plenty of funds.

### Step 2: Find out the Expense Ratio
All expenses related to mutual funds are together called Total Expense Ratio or TER. Total Expense Ratio is the annual expense incurred on the mutual fund held by an investor.<br/>

**_Here is a comparison from website bankbazaar.com_**

“So, if you have made an investment of Rs. 10,000 with an expense ratio of 1.5%, you will be paying Rs.150 to the fund house. If the fund grows by 10%, you will only receive 8.5% returns as 1.5% will be deducted as an expense ratio. If you are looking at a short-term investment, this amount may appear trivial but if you are making an investment for a period of say 15 years, this amount will get compounded. You will realise that you could have fetched higher returns if you had made the investment in a fund with a lower expense ratio.<br/>
How an investment of Rs.1 lakh will perform with different expense ratios over a period of 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years.

</a>

The above calculation is done considering 12% returns.”

**Therefore, an expense ratio of less than 1% is really desirable.**

### Step 3: Find out Exit Load
Exit load is an amount charged from an investor for exiting or leaving a scheme or the company as an investor.

### Step 4: Know your Plan
When it comes to investing in mutual fund schemes, there are mainly two types of plan
1. **Direct Plan:** In this plan, you get to invest in Mutual Funds directly without any help/assistance or reference from broker/agent. You get to save around 1-1.5% as commission which is huge amount of money. In order to do that, you must be well read and know each type of scheme and should very well know which scheme suits you best.
2. **Regular Plan:** In this plan, you invest through agent/broker. You are saved by the headache of going through plethora of schemes because your broker finds the best scheme for you. You pay commission as a fee.

Ask yourself, can’t you do a bit of research which may cost you a few hours but end up saving lakhs of rupees?<br/>
In my opinion, it’s best to go ahead with Direct Plan and eliminate all the middle men.

### Step 5: Get your KYC done.
**KYC (Know Your Customer)** is a one-time process which is mandatory for banking and investing purpose. It is a centralized process that is, once you have done it, you can invest in MF or stocks directly just by opening a demat account by providing your PAN card details.

You can walk in any Mutual Fund house, get your KYC done and invest through other MF house.

### Step 6: SIP vs Lump Sum
You can invest either as **Lump Sum** (All of money at a single go) or through **Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)** in which an amount is invested automatically every month just as same as EMI.
If you’ve hit a jackpot or inherited a fortune unexpectedly, invest it as a lump sum before you spend most of it!
If you’re a salaried person and live on monthly income, you can invest regularly using SIP. You can start from as low as INR 500.

Again, SIP vs Lump Sum requires a separate post for discussion.

## What is Net Asset Value (NAV)?
The money invested in MFs is used to buy some units. The value of these units at any specified time is called **Net Asset Value**.

## How to withdraw money?
You can login to your account using credentials provided by your fund house, choose Redeem option. Money will be automatically transferred to your savings account.

## How to buy Direct Plan?
You can visit the website of any Mutual Fund house and opt for direct plan. If you already have a demat account with any broker, you can invest through their platform for a very nominal fee.

## How to terminate Mutual Fund?
Stop paying them! xD

## What if I fail to pay the SIP?
Nothing will happen. There’s no fine as such.
