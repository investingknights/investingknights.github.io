In the previous post [Joining the Warriors (Stocks and Bonds)](https://investingknights.com/2018/03/18/joining-the-warriers/), we learned about the term **Stocks** and **Bonds** and how are they different.

It is a smart thing to join with a company thatâ€™s beating the others out of business and has strong market demand for its products.

So, youâ€™re interested in buying its stock. Hereâ€™s what you need to know before buying a stock. Note that **stock** and **share** more or less mean the same (letâ€™s keep it that way for you as beginners)
<!--more-->
## Basic terms for Stock Investors
- **STOCK EXCHANGE/ STOCK MARKET:** A place where investors buy or sell stocks. Note that you canâ€™t buy or sell shares on your own, you need a broker to do that for you.
- **STOCK BROKER:** A person or a firm who buys or sell stocks on your behalf in return for a small fee called as **brokerage**.

- **BULL MARKET:** Stock prices going up. Investors are optimistic.

- **BEAR MARKET:** Stock prices going down. Investors are pessimistic.

- **DIVIDENDS:** An amount of money per share distributed to shareholders just for owning the stock. Like a rent for an apartment owner.

- **INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO):** A company issuing its shares to public for the first time. You canâ€™t own shares in a private company who hasnâ€™t gone for an IPO.

- **MARKET CAPITALIZATION:** Total worth of companyâ€™s shares out there for public.

- **BLUE CHIP STOCKS:** Companies that have been around for long time on the market and are too big to fail.

- **PORTFOLIO:** Group of stocks that you own that specifies the price and quantity. Just like a file.

- **DEMAT ACCOUNT:** A type of account that is where your stocks are kept and this account is maintained by the stockbroker.

- **SENSEX/NIFTY:** Group of stocks selected from every sector so that it represents the whole market. **These are also called the benchmark index**.

Thatâ€™s all you need to know before buying your first stock.

## Steps to buy your first stock
1. Choose a broker
2. Open a demat account with them
3. Transfer money that you want to invest from your savings account to demat account.
4. Buy that stock.

**Thatâ€™s pretty much it!**

## Documents required to open demat account
1. Aadhar Card
2. PAN Card
3. 6 Months bank statement
4. One Cancelled check

Itâ€™s really simple to open a demat account and it can be opened within a week nowadays.

## Choosing a broker
Even though I have opened my demat account with Zerodha, I didnâ€™t find their platforms smooth enough. Often, I ended up with problems in buying stocks. 

**FYERS** is a new generation broker. Truly transparent with their operations and theyâ€™ve gone ahead to upload their certificates of registration, check out here https://fyers.in/why-us/
That said, Iâ€™ll highly recommend FYERS, they have zero brokerage too.

## Bombay Stock Exchange or National Stock Exchange?
It doesnâ€™t matter from where you purchase a stock.<br/> 
The prices are almost same on BSE or NSE.

## Which Stock to buy?
Thatâ€™s the last thing remaining to do.<br/>
But the point is, **if you ask this question then, what else will be left there for you to do?**<br/>

The choice of stocks that you buy makes all the difference whether you make or lose money.<br/>
