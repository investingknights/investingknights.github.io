In this post, we will learn about the mistakes that investors generally do in the beginning.<br/>
It is really easy to lose money in the market whereas making money is relatively tough.<br/>
Often, naïve investors tend to get swayed away by looking at the price chart which is as I’ve mentioned in the previous post [(How to analyze any stock)](https://investingknights.com/2018/03/28/how-to-analyze-stock/), is the last parameter to judge any stock.

Investing in stocks is somewhat similar to swimming, you got to learn the basics first. 

> **_If you enter in the pool without going through basics, you’re doomed to drown._**

<!--more-->
If you happen to make a profit in market without proper research on your investments then, it is pure luck!<br/> 
It is very unlikely that you can repeat it.<br/>
To earn consistently, you must have thorough knowledge and proper control over your emotions.<br/>
Overwhelming profit or loss can interfere with your rational decision-making skills.

Swimming can be learned by everyone irrespective of his/her qualification or expertise in anything other than swimming. It is not that only Olympic swimmers can swim and not common people.<br/>
Same goes for investing, you don’t have to a professional or MBA in finance to make money in the market. 

**“You got to look after your losses, the profits take care of themselves”**

True indeed, losses can burn a hole in a portfolio if not contained. Here are the few tips that I would like to share so that you can avoid the early mistakes that investors generally do.

# 1. TRADING
Most of the investors purchase the stocks with intention of booking profit within 1-2 weeks.<br/> 
This is very dangerous, people often book profits on multibagger stocks too early and hold on to the losing positions waiting for the stock to hit their target price.

Legendary investor, Peter Lynch calls this as **“Plucking the flowers and watering the weeds”**

You are certain to lose money if you let go of the winners and hold onto the losers.

If you are one of those who trade on the basis of tips from others then, it would be best for you to pack your bags and fly to Vegas because that way you can actually enjoy giving away your money rather than losing it in stocks.

# 2. SHORTING
Shorting is done by people who are certain that a particular stock will go down.<br/>
So they sell at high and buy at low.

I would like to remind you, if a stock goes from let’s say INR 300 to 0 then you are at 100% profit in case you’re short but, if there’s even a slight miscalculation or something missing in your assessment and the stock hits 1000 and goes on making new highs then, **YOUR LOSS WILL BE UNLIMITED!**

**_In other words, while shorting stocks, your upside is limited to 100% whereas downside is unlimited_**

# 3. HEDGING VIA DERIVATIVES (FUTURES AND OPTIONS)
These are meant for institutional investors and hedge funds who are very well equipped with the information needed to trade with derivatives.

You can never beat them at this because derivatives are zero sum game unlike investing in stocks.

Just imagine, an institution with several experienced, seasonal and qualified professional are taking positions against you in a derivative contract.

Can you beat them?

Of course, no!

In derivatives there are 2 parties, either of them will win or lose. It’s never a win-win situation that could benefit both.

**The only return over your investment that you can get in derivatives will be _DISAPPOINTMENT_**

## SO, WHAT’S THE SURESHOT WAY OF AVOIDING LOSSES AND EARNING CONSISTENTLY?
It’s really simple and easy but still, not everyone can do it!

**_THE ONLY WAY TO EARN CONSISTENTLY IS TO INVEST IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE PERFORMING GREAT (AND GIVING THEIR COMPETITORS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY) AND HOLDING THEM FOR ATLEAST 5-10 YEARS._**

Don’t believe me?

Why Warren Buffet is the only one in the last 70 years to do so?

Obviously, it’s easier said than done!

Therefore the following questions arises
