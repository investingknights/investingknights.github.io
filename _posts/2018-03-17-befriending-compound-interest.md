Compound Interest, the best friend that anyone can have, is also called as the **eighth wonder of the world** by none other than **Albert Einstein** himself!

**What‚Äôs so special about it?**

Well, let me demonstrate.
<!--more-->
Consider two persons, an **Investor** and a **Saver**.<br/> 
Assuming they both save an equal amount per month that is INR 10k.<br/>
The **Saver** puts his savings in a locker in the form of cash each month. If after let‚Äôs say 10 years we calculate the amount that he has with him, it turns out to be INR 12,00,000.

Quite impressive isn‚Äôt it?<br/> 
INR 12 lakh just by a small habit of saving regularly. That‚Äôs what our parents teach us, **saving is the first step towards accumulating wealth**.<br/>
>‚ÄúLook, you should save regularly so that you can buy that bike you always desired‚Äù<br/>

>‚ÄúYou want that sweet dress? Go save and buy yourself, we won‚Äôt be around every time to buy you stuff‚Äù

Even though our parents are correct, we should definitely save regularly but the point is, **little or no importance is given to investing that saved amount**. Almost zero knowledge is passed on about handling money. We always remain and get satisfied with step 1

Let‚Äôs move onto the second person that is, **Investor**.<br/>
He invested the amount that he saved in an investment scheme that generated a return of 15% compounded annually.<br/> 
Let‚Äôs have a look at what he has after 10 years

<img src="/images/posts/p3_2.png"/>

The amount that his investments have grown up to is INR 26,34,407.

**<u>Investor has beaten the Saver by an amount of INR 14,34,407</u>**. That is approximately 14 lakhs.

**How was he able to do that?**

**Where did that extra 14 lakhs come from?**

The answer is simple, **he befriended compound interest**.<br/>
Let me quote the definition of compound interest from Wikipedia

>‚ÄúCompound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on interest. It is the result of reinvesting interest, rather than paying it out, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously accumulated interest. Compound interest is standard in finance and economics‚Äù

Too boring definition for such an exciting phenomenon, that‚Äôs why I hate our school system.<br/>
We all have studied the compound interest but still, **we fail to befriend it and make it work for us**.

**<u>INVESTING IS THE WAY TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH COMPOUND INTEREST AND MAKE IT WORK FOR US</u>**

That said, I hope it is clear by now that **Investing is the second step to accumulate wealth**.<br/>

**What happens if Compound Interest works against us?**<br/>
Very well, those who don‚Äôt understand how money works end up paying compound interest.<br/>
Suppose you take a debt of INR 40 lakh at an interest rate of 9%<br/>
The time duration for returning the loan is 20 years.<br/>
Your monthly EMI (Equal Monthly Instalments) stands at INR 35,989.

<img src="/images/posts/p3_3.png"/>

Note that you paid INR 40 lakh that you took but also an interest of INR 46 lakh.<br/>
That brings the total amount to approximately INR 86 lakhs<br/>

**This extra interest that you paid is compound interest and this is by far an excellent example of compound interest working against you!**

*Taking a loan or debt is the opposite of Investing.*<br/>
If somehow, you make your mind to invest that monthly amount (INR 35,989) regularly in a mutual fund through Systematic Investment Planning (SIP) it‚Äôll do wonders.<br/>
Are you ready to see the **Power of Compounding**?<br/>
Get ready to be mind blown!

That‚Äôs a staggering amount. INR 4.78 crores!<br/>
Isn‚Äôt it amazing?<br/>
That‚Äôs compounding effect working for you with its full potential!<br/>
**Appreciate and realize the value of COMPOUND EFFECT!**<br/>
Even if you‚Äôre late enough to know this, it is never too late to invest.<br/>
I hope you now realize that how much important investing is
