After learning [How to Buy Stocks](https://investingknights.com/2018/03/22/how-to-buy-stocks/), through this post, we will learn whether a stock is worth buying or not.<br/>
Before buying any stock, we need to develop a story in our mind.<br/>
We should know exactly why any stock is in our portfolio.

**It is really necessary to develop this story because buying stocks without proper research is like playing cards without even looking at them.**
<!--more-->

You have to know the characters of this story first
- **EQUITY:** Generally, it means the net worth (total cash) of a company. It is usually obtained after subtracting liabilities from assets.<br/> 
For example, you have **INR 50 lakhs** in the form of your bank balance, cash in hand and after selling your assets (Car, house etc) and you have **20 lakhs as debt** then, **your equity is 50 lakhs (assets) – 20 lakhs (liability) = 30 lakhs**. It has different meanings in different contexts.

- **EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS):** It is the amount that company earns per share. It is calculated by dividing earnings by total number of shares.

- **GROWTH:** It is the rate at which earnings per share increase.

- **PROMOTER HOLDING:** Worth of stocks owned by the owners or managers of a company.

- **RETURN ON EQUITY (ROE):** It is the measure of how efficient a company is in generating profits. It is calculated by dividing profits by net worth or equity of a company.

- **P/E RATIO:** Also known as Price to Earnings ratio. It is used to determine whether the price of a share is justified as compared to earnings. Generally, it should lie between 15-40, although the lower the better.

- **D/E RATIO:** Debt Equity ratio is used to determine the amount of debt the company has as compared to its equity. The lower D/E ratio, the better it is for long run. Small companies with high D/E ratio tend to become bankrupt soon. Debt always eats into earnings.

- **PEG RATIO:** Price to Earnings to Growth ratio, It tells whether the P/E ratio is justified as compared to the growth of company. High growth company have high P/E ratio therefore, PEG is used to relate P/E ratio with Growth.

- **G FACTOR:** It is purely based on historical results (primarily latest quarterly results). It is just an indicator or growth in the quarterly numbers of a company. G Factor works best for small and mid-cap companies. A high G Factor might symbolize a good growth, but a low G Factor number doesn’t mean that a company is bad.

**That’s all.**

Now, how one gives weightage to each character makes up his investing style.<br/> 
Some people like to invest in big companies whereas some like to invest in companies that are small and have enough room to grow.<br/>
Once you’ve found your favourite company, you need to run through some numbers.<br/>
[**Screener.in**](https://www.screener.in/) is the website which I refer to whenever I have to study any company.

For example, I was wondering, with the growth of construction and automobile sector, [**Tata Steel**](http://www.tatasteel.com/) is in the position to capitalize on the potential of this industry.<br/> 
I checked Tata Steel on [**Screener.in**](https://www.screener.in/)<br/> 
Here is what I got.

{% lightbox images/posts/p6_1.png --thumb="images/posts/p6_1.png" --data="Peer Comparison" --title="Peer Comparison" --alt="Peer Comparison" --img-style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" %}

**CMP:** Current Market Price = INR 566.50<br/>
**P/E:** Price to Earnings Ratio = 14.29<br/>
**Market Capitalization:** INR 63,822 crores<br/>
**Profit Over 3 years:** -36.44% (loss)<br/>
**ROE:** Return on Equity 3 years = -4.62% (again, loss)<br/>
**PEG:** Price to Earnings to Growth ratio: -0.64 (we can’t use negative PEG ratio, hence useless)<br/>
**Profit Over 5 years:** -22.43% (loss)

Note that when you first use **Screener**, you don’t have all these options as beginner.<br/>
You can click on customize columns and add all the above characteristics.<br/>
**It might seem intimidating at first but it’s really fun to play with numbers and remember, you make money while playing.**<br/>
After analysing Tata Steel, I found a better company, [**Maithan Alloys**](http://maithanalloys.com/).<br/>
Here are its numbers

{% lightbox images/posts/p6_2.jpg --thumb="images/posts/p6_2.jpg" --data="Peer Comparison" --title="Peer Comparison" --alt="Peer Comparison" --img-style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" %}

**CMP:** Current Market Price = INR 800<br/>
**P/E:** Price to Earnings Ratio = 7.63<br/>
**Market Capitalization:** INR 2328 crores<br/>
**Profit Over 3 years:** 100.77% (profit)<br/>
**ROE:** Return on Equity 3 years = 27.50% (again, profit)<br/>
**PEG:** Price to Earnings to Growth ratio: 0.24<br/>
**Profit Over 5 years:** 31.74% (profit)

We have one more characteristic, **EPS**

{% lightbox images/posts/p6_3.png --thumb="images/posts/p6_3.png" --data="Peer Comparison" --title="Peer Comparison" --alt="Peer Comparison" --img-style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" %}

The last row which is highlighted in bold shows **earnings per share (EPS)** for Maithan Alloys for
1. Preceding previous financial year
2. Previous financial year
3. Last 12 months

Let’s compare both these stocks on each characteristic

### CURRENT MARKET PRICE:

Price for Tata Steel share is **INR 566.50** whereas for Maithan Alloys, it is **INR 800**.<br/>
The first thought to enter your mind is that **“Tata steel share is cheaper than Maithan Alloys, I can buy more stocks of Tata than Maithan.”**<br/>
I’ve taken this attribute first intentionally to make a special mention of my point

**<u>STOCK PRICE IS THE LAST PERIMETER TO JUDGE A STOCK</u>**

Usually, people look at price chart and enter in the stock if the price has been increasing continuously.<br/>
That’s very dangerous when it comes to investing in the market.<br/>
**You can never predict the future price of a stock by extrapolating the historical prices.**<br/>
Still don’t believe me? Have a look.

{% lightbox images/posts/p6_4.png --thumb="images/posts/p6_4.png" --data="Vakrangee Graph" --title="Vakrangee Graph" --alt="Vakrangee Graph" --img-style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" %}

This is the price chart for **Vakrangee.**<br/> 
The share price increases continuously from **INR 48 to INR 500** and then loses 50% and drops to INR 250.<br/>
I hope it’s clear now that stock price tells you nothing about a stock.

### Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio:

Price to Earnings ratio of Tata Steel is 14.29 and that of Maithan Alloys is 7.63.<br/>
That means, the stock is being sold 14.29 times of whatever Tata is earning per share whereas for Maithan, it is 7.63.<br/>
Therefore, Maithan Alloys is **actually the cheaper stock here**.<br/>
Again, P/E ratio is not the sole criteria for choosing a stock.<br/>
Lower the P/E ratio, the better it is but the point is, high growth companies have higher P/E ratio.<br/> 
**You can compare P/E ratio of companies in the same sector.**<br/>
Different sectors have different P/E ratio. Have a look.

{% lightbox images/posts/p6_5.png --thumb="images/posts/p6_5.png" --data="P/E Ratio" --title="P/E Ratio" --alt="P/E Ratio" --img-style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" %}

This data has been picked up from Moneycontrol.com for Maithan Alloys
Industry P/E for steel sector is 13.33<br/>
That means, Maithan is available at a massive discount or say at half the price it should be because it will be fairly priced even at the P/E of 13.33

**If Maithan attains a P/E of 10, it should be priced at 104.83(EPS) x 10(P/E) = INR 1048.3**

That said, P/E ratio of a company in steel sector cannot be compared with that of a company in chemical sector or finance sector.<br/>
Best practice is to compare with the industry P/E.

### Debt to Equity (D/E) Ratio:

When it comes to running a company, the amount of debt often comes in the way of expansion because the **Debt grows like a weed.**

**Debt is a threat to company’s earnings.** It can easily eat into earnings if the size isn’t checked.

Therefore, it is advised to check how much debt a company has before investing in it. In most cases, **it’s the debt that grounds companies and make them file for bankruptcy.**<br/>
However, it is also advised to check equity the company has, **as compared to debt.**<br/>

For example, a company with equity of 100 crore can easily afford a debt of 10-20 crore.<br/>
The debt equity ratio in this case becomes = 0.1 to 0.2

Now coming to our two companies, Tata has D/E = 85.56<br/>
**That means, for every single rupee the company has, it has a debt of INR 85.56**
That’s too much.<br/>
I personally stay away from such companies.

Now look at Maithan Alloys, D/E = 2.65<br/>
This is kind of acceptable given that this steel sector requires companies to purchase raw materials and equipment which needs a lot of cash that most of the time companies don’t have.<br/> 
As compared to Tata’s 85.56, it is very good. I personally don’t buy companies which have D/E more than 1.

**Low D/E ratio makes sure that the company has enough equity to sustain its business.**

### GROWTH (G Factor):

This score varies between 0-10<br/> 
Maithan has a score of 7 whereas Tata has a score of 2. This means that Tata has grown to such extent that it can’t grow further whereas Maithan has enough room to grow. This is quite evident from **Market capitalization (Tata = 63,822 crores and Maithan = 2328 crores)**<br/>
This score also reflects latest financial quarter results and profits.<br/> 
Higher the growth score, brighter are the prospects for future.

**The score keeps changing therefore a low score doesn’t mean the company can’t improve or vice versa.**

### Price to Earnings to Growth (P.E.G) Ratio:

As discussed earlier, companies that exhibit higher growth tend to have high P/E ratio.<br/>
Therefore, it becomes necessary to determine if the P/E ratio is consistent or justified with their growth.

**Here, Growth = Increase in earnings per share (EPS) in percentage (Quarter on quarter basis)**

Negative PEG means there was loss in last quarter hence, it becomes useless to compare.<br/>
Though, Maithan has a positive PEG = 0.24<br/>
That means, its P/E is fairly consistent with its EPS growth rate and **is better valued at its price.**

**Usually, PEG should not be more than 1.**<br/>
If PEG crosses the value of 1 then, stock price can come tumbling down anytime on a single bad news (bad quarter results, rumours etc).<br/>
Whereas, if PEG is less than 1, a single bad quarter doesn’t push down the stock price much.

### Profit Over 5 years:

This shows how the profit has been for companies over 5 years.<br/>
These companies exist for a single reason and that is, **PROFITS**<br/>
If a company is consistently making profits over years then, it is a sign of good management. **No one wants to invest in a company that has been losing money for a long time.**<br/>
Coming back to our 2 companies,

**Tata has profit of**
- **-36.44 %** over 3 years
- **-2243 %** over 5 years

These figures are compounded annually<br/>
It’s fairly clear from the numbers that Tata is running at a loss from last 5 years. I would stay away from Tata

**Maithan Alloys has profit of**
- 100.77 % over 3 years
- 31.74 % over 5 years

Maithan has been running in profit since last 5 years and has increased its profit since last 3 years. It is again a sign of good business and extraordinary management.

### Return on Equity (ROE):

As already discussed, ROE is used to determine how efficient is the company in making money.<br/>
Higher the ROE, higher the efficiency.

**ROE of TATA** 
- **4.62 %** over 3 years
- **4.70 %** over 5 years

**ROE of Maithan Alloys**
- **27.50 %** over 3 years
- **23.06 %** over 5 years

It’s clearly evident from the numbers that Maithan Alloys is far better and efficient in generating profits than Tata Steel.

### Earnings per Share (EPS):

Earnings is the major reason for movement of stocks.<br/>
**The stock price has to follow the direction of earnings.**<br/>
It can’t happen that stock price continue to increase while the company is running into losses.<br/> 
I will never invest in a company whose EPS is decreasing year on year.<br/>

**EPS for Tata Steel (historical)**
- **INR -3.40, loss**
- **INR -37.64, loss**
- **INR 8.90, profit**

EPS for Tata Steel is inconsistent therefore this should be reflected in the stock price.<br/> 
Look at the stock price. You can notice that stock price is increasing since last year, well that’s because EPS increased from -37.64 to 8.90

{% lightbox images/posts/p6_6.png --thumb="images/posts/p6_6.png" --data="TATA Steel Stock Price" --title="TATA Steel Stock Price" --alt="TATA Steel Stock Price" --img-style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" %}

**EPS for Maithan Alloys (historical)**
- **INR 27.15, profit**
- **INR 67.91, profit**
- **INR 104.83, profit**

EPS for Maithan Alloys is increasing year on year consistently.<br/>
As is said earlier, stock price follows the earnings.<br/>
Look at the stock price of Maithan Alloys.

### Checked all the parameters, what next?

Once you are done with the fundamentals of the company and satisfied with its historical performance and numbers, there is one thing remaining to do

**Go to MoneyControl.com** and check the latest news and announcements by the company’s promoters for future plans and capacity expansion. 
You can also read annual reports on the company’s website and read what the CEO has to say on its performance and what vision he has for further expansion.

**After going through all this, you now know what you’re investing in.**

### Is this exercise necessary for each time?

Yes, every freaking time you find a stock, you have to do this.<br/>
Moreover, you have to repeat this analysis every 3-4 months because numbers change.<br/>
Company can take up new debts or make a bad decision which ends up reducing the earnings and therefore EPS.

### Is the stock guaranteed to go up?

Nope, there is no guarantee that the stock will go up (for short term).<br/>
These fundamentals just minimize the risk for downside.<br/> 
**Sometimes, stock price tends to go against fundamentals but not for too long.**<br/>
**One day the reality has to kick in.**<br/>
**For long term (2-3 years), the stock price is destined to follow fundamentals.**
