In the [previous post](https://investingknights.com/2018/06/23/introduction-to-mutual-funds/), I talked about [Mutual Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) and how they can be beneficial for beginners who want to invest in equities.<br/>
In this post, we’ll learn about Index Fund and why it’s the best fund out there!

## What is Index Fund?
It is a fund that invest in benchmark indices such as SENSEX and NIFTY.<br/>
It is not actively managed by any manager hence it is very cost effective as compared to other funds.

For example, **UTI Nifty** fund has an expense ratio of 0.2% whereas **SBI Blue-chip** Fund has an expense ratio of 1.98% which is very high.

## Why it’s the best?
Well, when selecting a MF, what most of us do?<br/>
We just look at the previous track records of various MFs and select the best performer.<br/>
This is another national pastime, reviewing the past performance of funds. Thousands of hours are devoted to it. Books and articles are written about it. Yet with few exceptions, this turns out to be a waste of time.

**THAT’S A FUTILE EXERCISE!**

Markets change and conditions change and one style of manager or one kind of fund will not succeed in all seasons.

For some year the large cap stocks perform better therefore the large cap equity fund will do better.<br/> 
Then those stocks will be outperformed by mid-caps and mid cap equity funds will do better.

One very good example, stocks like [Unitech](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/construction-contracting-civil/unitech/U), [DLF](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/construction-contracting-real-estate/dlf/D04), [BHEL](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/infrastructure-general/bharatheavyelectricals/BHE), [JP Associates](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/infrastructure-general/jaiprakashassociates/JA02) etc were ruling the market during the bull run of 2005-08. Infrastructure and real estate stocks were leading this strong bull run and were considered as hot favourites among fund managers.<br/>
It is obvious that the funds invested in these stocks did better than others.<br/>
By 2009, the prices of these stocks fell by around 60-80% from their peak in 2008.<br/>
These stocks have still not recovered and people invested in them directly or indirectly (through MFs of course) have suffered a great loss. The Index performed significantly better than those stocks.

The next bull run was lead by pharmaceuticals 2013-17. Again, the fund invested in them did better than the market but nothing can be said about the future.

**It is very difficult to track the stock picks of your fund manager!**

What applies to stocks also applies to mutual funds, you just never know where the next great opportunities will be, so it pays to be multifarious.<br/>
If you own only one fund, you may find yourself stuck in a situation in which the managers have lost their touch, or in which the stocks in the fund have gone out of favour.<br/>
A value/growth fund, for instance, can be a wonderful performer for three years and awful for the next six.<br/>
Some people take last year’s biggest winner, the one at the top of 1-year achievers, and buy that fund. This is particularly foolish. **The 1-year winner tends to be a fund managed by someone who bet on one industry or one kind of company in a hot sector and got lucky.**<br/> 
Why else would he or she have been able to run so far ahead of the pack?<br/>
Next year, when this fund manager is not so lucky, his or her fund will be on the bottom.

**MOST FUND MANAGERS JUST STRUGGLE TO BEAT EVEN THE BENCHMARK INDEX.**

When you own an index fund, you're also protected against all the wrong, misguided or unlucky decisions that active fund managers are liable to make.

The lesson here is: 
> **don’t spend a lot of time poring over the past performance charts. That’s not to say you shouldn’t pick a fund with a good long-term record.**

But it’s better to stick with a steady and consistent performer than to move in and out of funds, trying to catch the waves.<br/>
Another major issue is what happens to a fund in a bear market. This, too, is a complicated subject. Some funds lose more than others but gain more on the rebound; some lose less and gain less; and some lose more and gain less. This last group is the one to avoid.

**Even the legendary investor, Warren Buffett has recommended to consistently buy low cost index funds.**<br/>
**According to him, “it's the thing that makes the most sense practically all of the time”**

> "Costs really matter in investments," Buffett says. "If returns are going to be 7 or 8 percent and you're paying 1 percent for fees, that makes an enormous difference in how much money you're going to have in retirement."

Rather than trying to score in a dart board, it makes sense to buy the whole board instead!

I don’t want to imply that you should not invest in other managed funds at all, it’s just that never forget the rule of diversifying.<br/>
Don’t put all your eggs in a single basket.

**_<u>The easiest approach is to divide up your money into six equal parts, buy six funds, and be done with the exercise. With new money to invest, repeat the process.</u>_**

Those six funds can be any type of the fund for example (just throw the dart on the screen)
* Large-cap
* Mid-cap
* Small-cap
* Index Fund
* Debt Fund
* Gold Fund
* Growth Fund
* Value Fund

You can buy Index funds the same way you buy any other mutual fund.

Thank you for reading 😊
