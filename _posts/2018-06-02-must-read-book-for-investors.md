It’s a well-known fact that all the legendary Investors, CEOs and Business-people have one thing in common – **they read a lot!**

There are several benefits accrued to the habit of reading such as
- Reduction of stress
- Improvement in memory
- Expansion of vocabulary
- Improvement in concentration and focus

In my opinion, it is just the surface.<br/> 
The benefits of reading a book can far exceed one’s imagination.

We learn from our mistakes, true indeed but given our lifetime, we will make limited mistakes and hence our learning is therefore limited.<br/> 
When facing a new problem, we produce most optimised solution after several iterations.

Reading a book can help us learn from other’s mistakes and give us a kind of head-start so that we don’t have to start from scratch.
<!--more-->
The problem might be new for you but it might be the case that someone must have encountered it before you. If you get a chance to communicate with them, you can improve the chances for your success.

**_That’s exactly what reading a book is!_**

By reading a book, you feel like you’re actually talking to the author, getting in his shoes and learning through their experiences.

Some mistakes can be costly but, a book can help you learn to not make those mistakes by avoiding them in the first place.<br/>
In my opinion, a book gives the best return over investment.

**Warren Buffet** read a lot of books on investing and went on to create a fortune worth billions of dollars.<br/> 
He always credits his success to certain books that helped him learn and develop a discipline.

So what better than a book costing just as much as a meal at McDonald’s?

**I hope you now know WHY you should read a book!**

In this post, I’ll suggest some books that are a **must-read** for every investor who intends to invest in stock market on his/her own without any professional help!

I have read these books in same sequence listed here.

## 1. [RICH DAD POOR DAD (by ROBERT T KIYOSAKI)](https://amzn.to/2JdwKS0)
This was the first book that I read on the subject of money and I was totally blown away after reading it and realizing why I learned all this so late in my life, it should’ve been taught in school.<br/>
Every single person, no matter what he does should read this book.<br/> 
It is a must read even if you’re not interested in stock market.<br/> 
This book provides such a valuable insight at something with which we all have to deal – **MONEY**

</a>

We have grown up with the mindset that we should work hard, get the best marks in every subject and get admission in best college, all this to end up with a decent and secure job.<br/>
When we start earning money, there’s not even a single person to advise the best use of it.<br/>
We end up spending most of it and then whine about us falling short on budget and also for an undeserved pay raise!

This book exactly states that the problem is not the amount of money, **it is us!**

Money is a subject in itself!<br/>
Unfortunately, most of us have not learned it and are **financially illiterate.**

**The book is a step in the direction for making money with money (exactly the reason why rich gets richer)**

## 2. [ONE UP ON WALL STREET (by PETER LYNCH)](https://amzn.to/2J5Lsyo)
After desire to make money with money, I was looking for ways to accomplish it.<br/>
Turns out, I was looking for ways of Investing.<br/>
The first readily available and easy investment technique: **STOCK MARKET**

  <img src="/images/posts/p8_2.jpg" alt="ONE UP ON WALL STREET" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
</a>

This book is a classic.<br/> 
To be honest, I was a bit worried wondering whether I am capable of investing in stock market given that I knew nothing about it and have heard a lot of stories where people lost a fortune in stocks, committing suicide, losing their house.<br/>
It is kind of scary because with money, stakes are real.

All thanks to **Peter Lynch**, the legendary investor who generated a compounded annual growth rate of 29.2% over 13 years beating even the likes of Warren Buffet (The Oracle of Omaha), all my fears went away when I realised it is very simple and easy to invest in market and make money.

He stresses on the fact that common people like us have a better advantage than professionals when it comes to investing in stocks that we know about.<br/>
The book gets humorous so many times making it a joyful read.

## 3. [LEARN TO EARN (by PETER LYNCH)](https://amzn.to/2kLbwQG)
Well, after reading One Up, I became a fan of Lynch and his writing style.
**It’s so simple and eloquent that I craved for it!**

<a href="/images/posts/p8_3.jpg" data-lightbox="LEARN TO EARN" data-title="LEARN TO EARN">
  <img src="/images/posts/p8_3.jpg" alt="LEARN TO EARN" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
</a>

This book basically provides the history behind the stock market and the idea of it.<br/>
Stock market is tool for companies to flourish and change the way we live.

It was a great learning experience and I got to know why Capitalism is good for emerging countries and not as bad as it is portrayed.

## 4. [BEATING THE STREET (by PETER LYNCH)](https://amzn.to/2J8FUmz)
The third and final book by Peter Lynch.<br/>
In this book, Lynch explains how he was able to remain profitable even during stock market crash and beating the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) each time during his career.

</a>

There is also a detailed explanation and rational reasoning behind some his stock picks both successful and unsuccessful.

He explains that even without analysing fundamentals, people can still make money if they observe carefully.<br/>
For example, some kids bought stocks of Playboy (of course for reasons other than fundamentals) by observing that it was selling really good and, they did end up making a lot of money via that stock.

## 5. [THE INTELLIGENT INVESTOR](https://amzn.to/2kGP62Q)
Written by Benjamin Graham, the mentor of one and only greatest investor in the world, Warren Buffet.<br/>
It was the first book ever that provided systematic approach to investing.

<a href="/images/posts/p8_5.jpg" data-lightbox="THE INTELLIGENT INVESTOR" data-title="THE INTELLIGENT INVESTOR">
  <img src="/images/posts/p8_5.jpg" alt="THE INTELLIGENT INVESTOR" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
</a>

Ben Graham always insists that price and value are two different things and one should buy or sell according to the nature of deviation.<br/>
I’ll be honest here; this book is not for beginners. In fact, even after going through standard books, I found it quite complex.<br/>
The commentaries at the end of each chapter are really helpful.

The initial chapters are only relevant for US stock and bond market though.<br/>
This book is Bible for value investors. Period.

## 6. [HOW TO AVOID LOSS AND EARN CONSISTENTLY IN STOCK MARKET (by PRASENJIT PAUL)](https://amzn.to/2xzeyRp)
This book provides all the knowledge condensed in one place.<br/>
It’s like summary of every stock market book I’ve read.

<a href="/images/posts/p8_6.jpg" data-lightbox="HOW TO AVOID LOSS AND EARN CONSISTENTLY IN STOCK MARKET" data-title="HOW TO AVOID LOSS AND EARN CONSISTENTLY IN STOCK MARKET">
  <img src="/images/posts/p8_6.jpg" alt="HOW TO AVOID LOSS AND EARN CONSISTENTLY IN STOCK MARKET" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
</a>

If you don’t have time to go through the above stock market classics then, this is the best one for you.<br/>
Most of the stuff written in this one was not new for me but it did cover everything I’ve learned.<br/>
One big plus point that this book has is; **It is written with solely Indian stock market in mind.**<br/>
Therefore, you may find examples of companies that you are familiar with.

## 7. [THE WARREN BUFFET WAY (by ROBERT G HAGSTROM)](https://amzn.to/2J4hR8l)
Best book ever written on Warren Buffet.

<a href="/images/posts/p8_7.jpg" data-lightbox="THE WARREN BUFFET WAY" data-title="THE WARREN BUFFET WAY">
  <img src="/images/posts/p8_7.jpg" alt="THE WARREN BUFFET WAY" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
</a>

Robert through his simple writing style, enables us to take a look at how Buffet analyses any business before he invests in it.<br/>
It details the key investment decisions that produced his unmatched record of performance.

Through this book, you can learn Buffet’s way of thinking and avoiding the mistakes that he did.<br/>
It has forewords by Peter Lynch, Kenneth L Fisher (son of Philip A Fisher), Bill Miller, Howard Marks.

There are some more books such as **Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits**, **The Essays of Warren Buffet** which I’m still reading.
I’ll add them later.
